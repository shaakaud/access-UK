NO-IP DNS service updater
==========================

https://www.noip.com/[noip.com] is a free(mium) website that offers to update
a IP against a domain name. This is a convenient way to update the IP of a host
that keeps changing and use a fixed human-friendly domain name to refer the
host. There is a HTTP API interface to update the IP against a hostname. This
script uses that to update its host's ip.

Setting it up
-------------

Edit the script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You will have to edit the first 4 values in the script to your values of choice:

----
username='lakshmankumar'
hostname='lakshmankumar.ddns.net'
interface_to_update='eth2'
passwordfile=os.path.join(os.path.expanduser("~"),".noippassword")
----

Run once interactively
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Invoke the script once interactively

----
noip_update.py -a -s
----

This will prompt for your noip.com site password and will save that in the ~/.noippassword
file(or to a different one if you updated the script as mentioned above)

You should see the script's output on stdout. Some sample outputs are:

----
payload:{'hostname': 'lakshmankumar.ddns.net', 'myip': '135.227.232.203'}
updated:nochg 135.227.232.203
----

----
payload:{'hostname': 'lakshmankumar.ddns.net', 'myip': '135.227.232.203'}
updated:good 135.227.232.208
----

Set up a cron
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have got the script update noip.com once, (and saved your password in a file on local
disk, you can add the script to your crontab so that it updates periodically)

----
crontab -e
*/5 * * * * /absolute/path/to/noip_update.py > /tmp/noip_log
----

That's it. Enjoy using your domainname.
