1. sudo yum install zsh
2. cd ~/software

   #google for "oh my zsh", click the first link and follow the steps - https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh
3. curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh

4. link ~/.zshrc to ~/access-UK/zsh/zshrc -> ln -s /home/udayakut/access-UK/zsh/zshrc .zshrc

5. cd ~/access-UK/git/
   curl https://github.com/git/git/raw/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh -OL
   cd ~/
   ln -s ~/access-UK/git/git-completion.zsh git-completion.zsh

6.  No need to follow this step if you have done step 1 in ~/access-UK/README
    Create the below soft links (vim to use bundle)
    $ls -lart .vimrc
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 udayakut udayakut 37 May 29 17:21 .vimrc -> /home/udayakut/access-UK/vim/vimfiles/vundle_vimrc*
    $mkdir ~/vimbundle; #Now open vim and give :PluginInstall
    $ ls -lart .vim
    lrwxrwxrwx 1 udayakut udayakut 35 May 29 17:22 .vim -> /home/udayakut/vimbundle/
    commands:
    ln -s ~/access-UK/vim/vimfiles/vundle_vimrc .vimrc;
    mkdir ~/access-UK/vim/vimbundle;
    ln -s /home/udayakut/access-UK/vim/vimbundle .vim;
    ln -s /home/udayakut/access-UK/zsh/zshrc.local .zshrc.local


7. Install autojump following instructions in the below webpage
   https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump
   commands:
   cd ~/software; git clone https://github.com/wting/autojump.git; cd autojump;./install.py
   #That would install autojump in ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh
   #This is now sourced in your zshrc (The install script would edit ur .zshrc, but i guess, i anyway have that line in my access-UK-repo).

8.Now install the git prompt plugin which will tell the git-status in PS1 
  cd ~/access-UK/zsh; git clone https://github.com/lakshmankumar12/zsh-git-prompt.git
  NOTE: cd zsh-git-prompt; open gitstatus.py and make sure :gitbinary='/usr/bin/git" ie it should point to the same path as seen in "type git"

9. Change the default shell to zsh
   chsh -s /bin/zsh;
   safer side - open default terminal (gnome terminal) and right click in middel and go to Profiles->profile-preferences->Title and Command tab. 
   Check "Run command as a login shell" and "Run a command command instead of my shell". Fill Custom command as /bin/zsh
