1. sudo apt-get install zsh or sudo yum install zsh
2. cd ~/software

   #google for "oh my zsh", click the first link and follow the steps (authored by robbyrussell - https://github.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/blob/master/README.md
3. curl -L https://raw.github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh/master/tools/install.sh | sh

4. link ~/.zshrc to ~/access-UK/zsh/zshrc -> ln -s ~/access-UK/zsh/zshrc .zshrc

5. cd ~/software
   curl https://github.com/git/git/raw/master/contrib/completion/git-completion.zsh -OL
   cd ~/
   ln -s ~/software/git-completion.zsh git-completion.zsh

6. ln -s ~/access-UK/zsh/zshrc.local .zshrc.local

7. Install autojump following instructions in the below webpage
   https://github.com/joelthelion/autojump
   commands:
   cd ~/software; git clone https://github.com/wting/autojump.git; cd autojump;./install.py
   #That would install autojump in ~/.autojump/etc/profile.d/autojump.sh
   #This is now sourced in your zshrc (The install script would edit ur .zshrc, but i guess, i anyway have that line in my access-UK-repo).

8.Now install the git prompt plugin which will tell the git-status in PS1
  //cd ~/access-UK/zsh; git clone https://github.com/lakshmankumar12/zsh-git-prompt.git
  cd ~/access-UK/zsh; git clone https://github.com/shaakaud/zsh-git-prompt.git
  NOTE: cd zsh-git-prompt; open gitstatus.py and make sure :gitbinary='/usr/bin/git" ie it should point to the same path as seen in "type git"

9. Change the default shell to zsh
   chsh -s /bin/zsh;
   safer side - open default terminal (gnome terminal) and right click in middel and go to Profiles->profile-preferences->Title and Command tab.
   Check "Run command as a login shell" and "Run a command command instead of my shell". Fill Custom command as /bin/zsh
